        Parameters
        ----------

        temp : int, optional
            What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2.
            Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random,
            while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic

        p : int, optional
            An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling,
            where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass.
            So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
